## Why impute race/ethnicity ?

Real-world data being messy and incomplete is more of a rule than exception. Non-existent, unreliable or incomplete race/ethnicity data can be especially detrimental to insights drawn from community research and policies that are informed by this research. For example, if outcomes of a program to address health disparities among Hispanic/Latino people in Mecklenburg county was evaluated using a mix of survey or administrative data, and the self-reported race/ethnicity responses in this datasets were largely missing or of poor quality, conclusions drawn from the analysis about the success of this program can be circumspect or unusable. High quality race/ethnicity data is important to accurately represent the demographic characteristics of communities, identify and address disparities, promote and center equity and make research inclusive and sensitive to a diverse population. 

Imputation is an important technique in social science research to address missing data.

## Introducing Bayesian improved surname geocoding

Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) is a method used to impute race/ethnicity based on surname and geographic location data. BISG uses a probabilistic algorithm to estimate the race/ethnicity of an individual based on their surname and the racial/ethnic composition of the geographic area where they reside. 


### How BISG Works

This methodology combines surname analysis with geocoded data to estimate an individual’s race. Put another way, BISG calculates the conditional probability that an individual belongs to a particular racial group based on their name and geolocation using the US Census Bureau’s Surname list and demographic data at a variety of different geographic levels such as county, tracts, and blocks. Running this function provides researchers with a set of new variables that provide the probability that an individual would be considered White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Other.

The process to acquire these estimates remains relatively straightforward. The first step is to load the "wru" package into the R environment and then import the dataset in which we want to impute race/ethnicity data. It should be noted that we elected to use the statewide version of the North Carolina voter file so we could validate the accuracy of the race/ethnic predictions of the BISG model (interested readers can refer to the [white paper](link here) for a detailed walk through on this process). Once the Census data has been acquired, the only other command is to run the predict_race function to generate the predicted race/ethnicity for each individual in the dataset.   

Caveats

surnames are not a foolproof indicator of race/ethnicity and can be influenced by cultural and historical factors such as immigration, adoption, and intermarriage.

Studies have shown that BISG can achieve high accuracy rates for some racial/ethnic groups, such as non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. However, accuracy rates may be lower for other groups, such as Hispanic/Latino individuals or those with multiracial backgrounds. In addition, BISG may not accurately capture the diversity and complexity within and across racial/ethnic groups.

should be used in combination with other data sources and approaches, and its results should be interpreted with caution and sensitivity.

## Applications of BISG

BISG remains a relatively new technique for researchers, with Imai and Khanna (2016) publishing their approach to using Bayes rule with the Census surname list less than a decade ago. Yet, this method has been used to answer various questions, such as:

* Comparing political behavior and participation
* Understanding disparities in housing evictions
* Estimating the risk of police use of force
* Assessing inequalities in flood vulnerability
